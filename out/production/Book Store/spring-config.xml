<!--
    Here, you can configure your implementations by telling the bookDao which implementation
    you need. Users of your application will configure this file as the as they need to. For example
    one user could have a Jdbc implementation, another one a Hibernate implementation or even
    a customized implementation if they'd like to.

    For testing purposes you could comment/uncomment the provided implementations to see the
    app in action :)
